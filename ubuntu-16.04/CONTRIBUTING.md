# External contributors

Thank you for taking interest in our PostgreSQL setup. We welcome contributions to this repository, but with a caveat we'd like to make clear to avoid disappointment.

Our aim is for this repository to reflect how we run PostgreSQL. This means that we're unlikely to merge changes to the PostgreSQL or Pacemaker setup as it would no longer reflect our usage of them.

Improvements to the automation of the local setup are more likely to be merged, along with contributions to documentation.

We also welcome the use of issues as a way to ask us questions about the setup.
